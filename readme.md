# Introduction

This is the repository for my solution to the [VueJS Developer Applicant Challenge](https://awesomemotive.com/vuejs-developer-applicant-challenge/).

*Note: I used React instead of VueJS for this challenge as agreed.*

# Plugin Installation & Activation

I used Node v18.18.1 during development. A similar version is recommended when installing dependencies to avoid any issues.

Follow these steps to installing the plugin:
1. Clone the repository to a location inside the `wp-content/plugins` folders of your local WordPress site.
2. Run `npm install` and then `composer install` from a terminal inside the root plugin directory.
3. Activate the plugin in the WordPress admin.
4. Go to the (top-level) `Test Project` admin settings page.

# Plugin Usage

Once the plugin is installed and activated you should be able to see the plugin admin setting page.



The table tab is displayed by default.

Add instructions for things to try to show off the app features. Maybe with screenshots?
